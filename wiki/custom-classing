There's clearly a market comprised of people who want [i]actual guidelines[/i] for making remotely balanced custom content. Almost everyone I've ever played with has bemoaned how difficult it is to make a character that fits their head-space concept.

In any case, speaking on trying to create cross-class characters or gishes...
If you're [i]already[/i] giving guidelines to a person about creating a class from the ground up, setting some basic restrictions shouldn't be that ridiculous. A person who wants to tinker, and is using a guide book, would theoretically be inclined to follow the guidelines within said book... or else they wouldn't bother purchasing it. Right?

So, just set certain restrictions on mixing power-types, or too many power types. ... I'm getting ahead of myself.

[b]What If...[/b]
[list][*]Each Class has a mandatory Power Source
[*]Mixing Power Sources happens in a pre-constructed way (Pre-Mixed Power Sources... P(i)MPS)
[*]Pre-Mixed Power Sources give 1 of 3 different power styles
    1. Infused-Melee (Sword Mage): [Paladin, Bearbearian] Melee power sets based off of associated caster-speellz. The spells are typically instant and/or toggle-able buffs. So you'd buy or acquire abilities like exploding strikes (fireball), ally-boosting auras (Bear Strength, Cat's Grace, etc), warp-stepping and flight.
    2. Battle Mage (Avatar) : [i][ Ranger, Bard, Scout, Ninja, etc ][/i] Skirmish power sets that rely a lot more on magic powers to carry you. Maybe you'd use a lot of instant effects mixed with channeled spells from range. Buying things like Rays shot from your bow, instant fire balls/missiles, walls of thorns/flames/ice, entanglement, obscuring mists, etc.
    3. Gish: [i][The Adventurer][/i] You grab a whole bunch of utility spells in, mostly, ritual format. Spells you want to utilize in battle are imbued into items before you adventure for the day. You are a wizard who fights and eschews battle casting. So... an artificer?

[b]What If...[/b]
[list]
[*]Each class is 1 of 3 broad archetypes: Brute, Gish, Cannon
[*]Each class is mandated to have a "Power Source" (melee is not a power source)
[*]Each class has a "signature style" that the Archetype and Power Source interact with.
[/list]

[eg]---
{Style} {Source} {Archetype}
Raging Arcane Brute

[Archetypes]---
Brute
* Role : Front Line
* Power sources provide enhancements directly to the Brute (and those in the thick around them), making them the epitome of "Legendary Warriors"
* Spell "selection" is limited, being focused on direct or shorter-ranged attacks, movement and morale. But with the benefit of flexible or instantaneous application.
  # eg
  # Attack enhancements : [Elemental] weaponry, explosive attacks, booming stomps
  # Movement : Rapid movement, hulk leaping, spell stepping (short teleport bursts), flying, dimensional tearing
  # Morale : Fear/courage auras, auras of bull's strength/cat's dex/etc..., auras of protection
  # Enhancements : Enlargement, Limited shape changing...
* Example classes
  # Barbarian (Totemic flavor)
  # Paladin
  # Crusader
  # Ranger(?)

Gish
* Role: Skirmish
*
* Spells are m

  # Ranger (?)
  # Ninja
  # Cleric

Cannon
